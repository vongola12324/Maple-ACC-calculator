# MapleStory Accuracy Calculator

A single-page web application for calculating hit rates against monsters in MapleStory.

## Overview

This tool helps MapleStory players calculate their accuracy and hit rates against various monsters in the game. It provides both physical and magical accuracy calculations based on character stats and monster data.

## Features

- **Accuracy Calculations**: Calculate hit rates for both physical and magical attacks
- **Monster Database**: Comprehensive database of monsters organized by world/region
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for specific monsters by name
- **Sorting Options**: Sort monsters alphabetically or by level
- **Monster Details**: View detailed monster information including:
  - Level and Avoid stats
  - HP and EXP values
  - Elemental weaknesses and resistances
  - Monster image
- **Link to MapleStory Library**: Direct links to the official MapleStory monster library

## How to Use

1. **Select a World**: Choose a world/region from the dropdown menu
2. **Select a Monster**: Pick a monster from the list or use the search function
3. **Enter Character Stats**:

   - Enter your ACC stat (for physical) or INT stat (for magical)
   - Enter your LUK stat (for magical attacks only)
4. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to see your hit rate

## Calculation Results

The calculator provides three key pieces of information:
- **Accuracy for 1%**: The minimum accuracy needed for a 1% hit rate
- **Accuracy for 100%**: The accuracy needed for a guaranteed hit
- **Hit Rate**: Your current hit rate percentage based on your stats

## Technical Details

- Built as a single-page application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests
- Monster data stored in JSON format organized by world/region
- Implements different formulas for physical and magical accuracy calculations
- Supports internationalization with multiple language options

## Internationalization

The application supports multiple languages through a custom i18n implementation. Currently, it supports:

- English (US)
- Traditional Chinese (Taiwan)

### Adding a New Language

To add a new language to the application:

1. **Add a new entry to the `SupportedLanguages` enum in `i18n.js`**:

   ```javascript
   const SupportedLanguages = {
     'en-US': {
       code: 'en-US',
       name: 'English (US)',
       flag: 'üá∫üá∏',
       displayName: 'English (US)'
     },
     'zh-TW': {
       code: 'zh-TW',
       name: 'Chinese (Traditional)',
       flag: 'üáπüáº',
       displayName: 'ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá'
     },
     // Add your new language here, for example:
     'ja-JP': {
       code: 'ja-JP',
       name: 'Japanese',
       flag: 'üáØüáµ',
       displayName: 'Êó•Êú¨Ë™û'
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Create a translation file**:
   
   Create a new JSON file in the `translations` directory with the same name as your language code (e.g., `ja-JP.json` for Japanese).

3. **Add translations**:
   
   Copy the content from `en-US.json` and translate all the values (right side) while keeping the keys (left side) unchanged. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "Select Language": "Ë®ÄË™û„ÇíÈÅ∏Êäû",
     "Monster Selection": "„É¢„É≥„Çπ„Çø„ÉºÈÅ∏Êäû",
     // ... more translations
   }
   ```

That's it! The language selector will automatically include your new language, and the system will handle loading the translations when a user selects it.
